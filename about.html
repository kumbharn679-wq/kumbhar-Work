            <p>
            We come from a traditional Kumbhaar family with generations of experience 
            in clay craftsmanship. Our art is not just work—it is devotion passed down 
            through time, shaped by hands that respect tradition and faith.

            <h3 class="section-common--title">Handcrafted with Devotion</h3>
            <p>
            Every Ganpati idol is carefully handcrafted using natural clay and traditional
             techniques. From shaping to detailing, each step is done with patience, purity,
              and devotion to Lord Ganesha.

            <h3 class="section-common--title">Eco-Friendly & Natural</h3>
            <p>
            We use eco-friendly Shadu clay and natural colors that dissolve easily in water,
             protecting our rivers and environment. Our idols return to nature just as nature
              created them.
